- Concepts
  - OOP
    - Encapsulation - idea of bundling up data and methods that perform a certain functionality into one unit, i.e. the class, and creating limitations on how other classes can access
      said fields and methods (Links up with access modifiers). This way, we can protect the class's fields from being modified in a way that breaks it which may create errors
      within the program.
    - Abstraction - the idea of hiding any complexity and unnecessary details from the user or from a outside class and instead only showing the functionality. Purpose is to allow for other
      classes to use it without having to worry about the intricacies of the underlying structure.
    - Inheritance - allows us to expand the functinality of a class by allowing it to share fields and methods from another class and expanding upon it without having to re-write code. Purpose to prevent us from  
      having to re-write code and to expand the core-code dynamically.
    - Polymorphism -
- What is GIT?
  - What is version control? What are the types and where does GIT fit into this?
  - GIT commands: git add, git status, git log, git commit, git clone, git init, git reset, git revert, git push, git pull
  - Repositories
  - Branches/Branching
  - Commits
  - Pull request - requesting a merge
  - Repository Permissions
  - Merge Conflicts and resolutions
  - Forking
  - .gitignore
- Dotnet SDK
  - environment
  - dotnet runtime (CLR - Common Language Runtime)
  - compiling to an intermediate language (CLI - Common Language Infrastructure)
- C# Topics
  - Access modifiers (public, private, internal, protected)
  - Data Types
    - Value vs. Reference types
  - Control Flow
  - Operators
    - Logical, Arithmetic, Comparative
  - Classes
    - Fields / States / Members
    - Methods
  - Namespaces
  - Branching/Conditional Statements
  - Exceptions
    - Throwing exceptions
    - Exception handling
  - Abstract classes
  - Overriding / Overloading
  - Type Conversion
  - Data structures: Arrays, Lists, stacks, queues
  - Memory Architecture
